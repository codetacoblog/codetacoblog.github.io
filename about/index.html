Inside you will find mostly professional discussions that cover topics an average software engineer will come across in their daily programming tasks. By writing here, we learn from each other and also deepen our knowledge of our craft as we research to create great content. Hopefully you, the reader, will find our effort valuable as well. Please feel free to <a class="link" href="mailto:codetacoblog@gmail.com">reach out to us</a> if you would like us to cover a specific topic!</p>
